        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chili powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water or beef broth</li>
        <li>8-10 taco shells or flour tortillas</li>
        <li>Shredded lettuce</li>
        <li>Diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Shredded cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
        <li>Salsa</li>
        <li>Sliced jalapeños (optional)</li>
        <li>Chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>Lime wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the diced onion and cook for 3-4 minutes until softened and translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the minced garlic and cook for another 30 seconds until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef to the skillet, breaking it up with a wooden spoon. Cook for 5-7 minutes until the meat is browned and no longer pink. Drain excess fat if necessary.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chili powder, cumin, paprika, oregano, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper (if using). Mix well to coat the meat evenly with the spices.</li>
        <li>Pour in the water or beef broth and stir to combine. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 5-7 minutes until the liquid has mostly evaporated and the mixture has thickened.</li>
        <li>While the meat simmers, warm the taco shells in the oven according to package directions, or heat flour tortillas in a dry skillet for about 30 seconds per side.</li>
        <li>Prepare all your toppings by shredding the lettuce, dicing the tomatoes, grating the cheese, and arranging everything in serving bowls.</li>
        <li>Taste the taco meat and adjust seasoning with additional salt or spices if needed.</li>
        <li>Spoon the seasoned beef into the warmed taco shells or tortillas.</li>
        <li>Set out all the toppings and let everyone build their tacos with their favorite combinations. Serve with lime wedges on the side for squeezing over the top.</li>
    </ul>
