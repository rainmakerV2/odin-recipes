    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 pound Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 onion, diced</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 (6-ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 (15-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (16-ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>In a large pot over medium heat, cook the ground beef, Italian sausage, onion, and garlic until the meat is browned and the onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Drain excess fat.</li>
        <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water to the pot. Stir in the sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>While the sauce simmers, cook the lasagna noodles according to package directions. Drain and rinse with cold water to prevent sticking. Set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, and parsley. Mix until well blended and set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Arrange 4 lasagna noodles over the sauce, overlapping slightly if needed. Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, then sprinkle with 1 1/3 cups mozzarella and 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Top with 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat the layering process: 4 noodles, remaining ricotta mixture, 1 1/3 cups mozzarella, 1/4 cup Parmesan, and 1 1/2 cups meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the final layer of 4 noodles and top with the remaining meat sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover the baking dish tightly with aluminum foil (spray the foil with cooking spray to prevent cheese from sticking) and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown. Let the lasagna rest for 15 minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ul>
