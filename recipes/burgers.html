    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A perfectly cooked cheeseburger is one of life's simple pleasures. This recipe delivers a juicy, flavorful burger with a beautifully seared crust, melted cheese, and all your favorite toppings nestled in a toasted bun. Whether you're firing up the grill for a backyard barbecue or cooking on the stovetop for a quick weeknight dinner, this classic cheeseburger never disappoints.</p>
    <p>The key to a great burger is using quality ground beef with the right fat content and handling the meat gently to keep it tender. Season generously, don't press down on the patties while cooking, and let them rest briefly before serving. With these simple techniques and fresh toppings, you'll have restaurant-quality burgers that will have everyone coming back for seconds.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 pounds ground beef (80/20 blend)</li>
        <li>Salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>4 slices cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
        <li>Lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>Sliced tomatoes</li>
        <li>Sliced red onion</li>
        <li>Pickle slices</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Mustard</li>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Divide the ground beef into 4 equal portions (about 6 ounces each) and gently shape into patties about 3/4-inch thick. Make a small indent in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent bulging during cooking.</li>
        <li>Season both sides of the patties generously with salt, black pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.</li>
        <li>Heat a grill or large skillet over medium-high heat. If using a skillet, add a small amount of oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Place the patties on the hot grill or skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes without moving them, allowing a nice crust to form.</li>
        <li>Flip the burgers and cook for another 3-4 minutes for medium doneness. During the last minute of cooking, place a slice of cheese on each patty and cover with a lid to help it melt.</li>
        <li>While the burgers cook, spread butter on the cut sides of the hamburger buns and toast them on the grill or in a separate pan until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Remove the burgers from heat and let them rest for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spread your choice of condiments (mayonnaise, ketchup, mustard) on the bottom bun.</li>
        <li>Layer the lettuce, tomato slices, and red onion on the bottom bun.</li>
        <li>Place the cheeseburger patty on top of the vegetables, add pickle slices, and crown with the top bun. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ul>
